# Repository Agent Instructions

## Workflow
- Never push directly to `main`.
- Always create a branch and open a PR.
- Summarize changes instead of dumping full files in updates.

## Quality
- Prefer removing dead or duplicate code over preserving backwards compatibility.
- Keep Apps Script code compatible with `.js` conventions and runtime limitations.
